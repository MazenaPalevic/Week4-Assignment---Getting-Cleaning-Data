# Week4-Assignment---Getting-Cleaning-Data

This is the Coursera assignment needed to accomplish Data Science with R track from Johns Hopkins University. 
This extensive assignment requires students to download zipped data from a public domain and concatenate different files into one table to then analyse it further. 
I had to follow steps below:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


Assignment has been completed using Windows and Rx64 3.6.3 version.
